<h2>January 28 / Feb 4: People card for Alex</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the first class, so it looks like I'll be creating a profile for myself!</p>

<p>Final codepen with hover effect can be found <a href="http://codepen.io/alexgolden/pen/xZamYg">here</a>.</p>

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="xZamYg" data-default-tab="result" data-user="alexgolden" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/alexgolden/pen/xZamYg/'>[DGMD E-15] people page card</a> by Alexander Golden (<a href='http://codepen.io/alexgolden'>@alexgolden</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>This is actually a combination of two effects:</p>

<h3>1. Highlight on hover</h3>
<p>I like attention to be the center of attention (OK not actually, but I had to make up some excuse for the effect).  The hover effect naturally draws the user's eye towards whatever is under the mouse.

<h3>2. Back card slide out</h3>
<p>Because I'm so good looking (again, not actually), you probably want to continue seeing my photo while looking at my contact information.  By sliding the back of the card out (rather than having the card flip), you can see both the picture of the person and their contact info simultaneously.</p>

<h2>May 5: The end is near</h2>

<p>So I managed to make it through the entire semester without updating this diary very often.  Oh well; suffice it to say, though, that I did learn a lot!</p>

<h3>AngularJS / React / Flux</h3>

<p>I used this semester to refresh my Javascript skills.  The last time I had attempted Javascript, it was a crappy scripting language that couldn't do much other than validate form inputs.  It's clear that it has come a looooooong way in the past several years.</p>

<p>Specifically, I learned a bunch about AngularJS, React, and Flux, which I used to build my prototype.  I cheated, in that I created something for my day job: Selling insurance.  I set out to design and build a clickable prototype that could prove that getting an insurance quote on a mobile device need not be a painful, slow, ugly experience.</p>

<p>Probably my greatest technical achievement was the creation of a swipeable navigation component that would make the quoting process more touch-responsive.  I started with a carousel component and modified it to meet my needs</p>

<p>The result is available online at <a href="https://potatodev.agolden.io">https://potatodev.agolden.io</a>.  It's still just a clickable prototype, and I clearly have a long way to go.  But it's been a great learning experience and I think a lot of my work will ultimately be reusable - hopefully in something that actual customers will some day see!</p>

<p>Be sure to view this on a mobile device or on Chrome in device mode:  I didn't have the time to do a fully responsive site.</p>
