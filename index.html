<h2>February 4: code snippets based on Alec's /people card</h2>

<p>While thinking through the effect for Alec's card, I broke down my building process into a few steps. <b>First</b>, I had to remove Alec's normal headshot image and replace it with my head-on-a-bike image. <b>Second</b>, I had to move that new image of the screen, so it would appear to be biking away. <b>Third</b>, I needed to return to the original image in its original location.</p>

<p>Below, you can see what we call "code snippets" inspired by this larger process. By breaking a more complicated program into small pieces, it can be easier to figure out what needs to happen in order to get your desired effect.</p>

<h2>January 28: people card mock-ups for Alec</h2>

<p>Final codepen with card effect can be found <a href="http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/eJrKvQ">here</a>.</p>

<p>But this is just one of a few ideas going in. Here are the sketches I made as I brainstormed and talked about the card with Alec.</p>

<h3>1. Look at me / Don't look at me</h3>

<p>Alec is a shy and quiet person. He doesn't like to make loud noises, to be involved in physical comedy, to speak in public. So, I thought he'd love having his card sporlighted whenever people mouse over it!</p>

<h3>2. Does a head on a bicycle have consciousness?</h3>
<img width="600" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dgmde15/people-mockups/IMG_2757.JPG">
<p>Alec bicycles everywhere. Including off the /people page, to avoid your attention.</p>

<h3>3. Robot on hover</h3>
<img width="600" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dgmde15/people-mockups/IMG_2758.JPG">
<p>Alec is something of an extreme person. He keeps a strict, structured, and very full schedule. He can forego sleep and food. He believes in optimal solutions. Is he secretly a robot?</p>
