## people card mock-ups for Alec

1. Look at me / Don't look at me

Alec is a shy and quiet person. He doesn't like to make loud noises, to be involved in physical comedy, to speak in public. So, I thought he'd love having his card sporlighted whenever people mouse over it!

2. Does a head on a bicycle have consciousness?

Alec bicycles everywhere. Including off the /people page, to avoid your attention.

3. Robot on hover

Alec is something of an extreme person. He keeps a strict, structured, and very full schedule. He can forego sleep and food. He believes in optimal solutions. Is he secretly a robot?
